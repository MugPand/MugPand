## Hi there 👋

### I'm a computer science graduate passionate about building the next **big idea**.💡

My workdays are generally spent researching low-level technologies or building internal tools that help optimize manual tasks, however, off-work my true interests lie in full-stack development. I'm always keeping up to date with the latest web technologies and I've recently taken up an interest in distributed systems and cloud computing. I enjoy keeping myself busy with side projects so stay tuned for some of my upcoming releases.

Outside of tech, I enjoy working out, solving puzzles, and playing ping pong. 🏓

I'm always looking for new opportunities so feel free to reach out!
