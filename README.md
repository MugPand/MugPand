### Hi there 👋

I'm a class of 2023 student majoring in Computer Science @ Rutgers University - New Brunswick. I love everything tech; ranging from testing out new hardware to developing mobile applications. In particular, I love developing interesting projects in Python and Java with the occasional HTML/CSS/JS needed for front-end development. 💻

Outside of programming, I enjoy photography, video editing, and logic puzzles. 📷
